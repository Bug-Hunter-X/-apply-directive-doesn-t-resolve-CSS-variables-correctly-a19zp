The best solution is to avoid using `@apply` with CSS variables. Directly apply the styles in your class definition:

```css
/* bugSolution.css */
:root {
  --my-color: blue;
}

.my-class {
  background-color: var(--my-color);
}
```

This ensures the variable is correctly resolved and the expected styles are applied.  Consider refactoring any `@apply` directives that rely on CSS variables to use direct style application instead.
